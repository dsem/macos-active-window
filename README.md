# MacOS Active Window

This produces a CLI command `get-active-window` which retuns the name of the
active window in MacOS.

It exists only to support my fork of
[dsem/macpaste](https://github.com/dsem/macpaste), which needs to know when the
active window is iTerm2.

## Installation

Install with `pipx`:

```
pipx install <path to this repository>
```
